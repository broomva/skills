# Mutation proof for spec_check.
#
# Each mutant is a semantic WEAKENING of exactly one check. A mutant that
# survives means the suite passes with that check disabled — the check is
# decorative and the tests that "cover" it prove nothing.
#
# The whole skill directory is copied to a scratch dir and mutated THERE. The
# working tree is never written to, so an interrupted run cannot destroy
# uncommitted work and there is no revert step that could restore a stale mtime.
#
# THREE THINGS THIS HARNESS DOES THAT THE OBVIOUS ONE DOES NOT. The first cut
# had all three holes and a cross-model review found them:
#
#   1. A nonzero exit is NOT a kill. `PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--bogus` made the first
#      version report "killed 14/14" while pytest collected nothing. A kill now
#      requires pytest to have RUN the same number of tests as the clean
#      baseline and to report at least one FAILED.
#   2. A crash is NOT a kill. Mutating `if not m:` to `if False:` leaves a None
#      dereferenced two lines later, so the "kill" was an AttributeError, not an
#      assertion detecting weakened behaviour. Mutants now disable the FINDING,
#      never the guard that makes the finding reachable, and any mutant killed
#      only by an unexpected exception is reported CRASH and fails the run.
#   3. The harness needs its own positive control. A NULL mutant — a comment
#      change that alters nothing — must SURVIVE. If it is reported killed, the
#      harness is broken and every other verdict is worthless.
#
# Usage:  tests/mutation.sh [python]
